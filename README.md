A project with the aim of (someday) compiling [obfs4proxy][obfs4]
([alternate repo link][obfs4-alt]) for use on iOS. Obfs4proxy is a
[pluggable transport][pt] for [Tor][tor], which can allow users to defeat
certain types of network censorship. (Read some great information about
pluggable transports — and how they work — [here][pt1] and [here][pt2].)

This work is supported in part by [The Guardian Project][guardian].
